# Build Plug-ins with AD FS 2019 Risk Assessment Model

You can now build your own plug-ins to block or assign a risk score to authentication requests during various stages â€“ request received, pre-authentication and post-authentication. This can be accomplished using the new Risk Assessment Model introduced with AD FS 2019. 

## What is the Risk Assessment Model?

The Risk Assessment Model is a set of interfaces and classes which enable developers to read authentication request headers and implement their own risk assessment logic. The implemented code (plug-in) then runs in line with AD FS authentication process. For eg, using the interfaces and classes included with the model, you can implement code to either block or allow authentication request based on the client IP address included in the request header. AD FS will execute the code for each authentication request and take appropriate action as per the implemented logic.

## About this sample

This sample plug-in is meant to better understand how to build a risk assessment plug-in and run it in line with AD FS process. The code in this sample uses the new interfaces and classes introduced with the risk assessment model to block the requests coming from certain extranet IPs identified as risky.
